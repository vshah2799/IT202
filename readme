IT 202 Repository - Vishal Shah
This repository is for my (Vishal Shah) IT 202 projects and assignments. The Assignment 3 folder contains
all files related to the project we had to turn in called "Assignment 3". The Midterm folder is for the
replacement midterm we had to do. The "OldOrNotWorkingCode" folder is for all files that are discontinued
from use or ones that have something that does not work and needs to be fixed if it will be implemented.
The Week 2 folder is the main folder where the majority of the course's work was done. It contains finalized
code from the two major assignments and prototypes we had to do.
